# Study Design
![Do different weight initialization matter? The study is designed from the perspective of an AI user who can choose between multiple pretrained model options for a given task. The best pretrained model is the one that is least effected domain shift. This study provides a framework to choose amongst pretrained models and select the most advantageous for the task.](images/Figure-flow-diagram.png)
