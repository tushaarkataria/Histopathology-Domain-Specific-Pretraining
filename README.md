Figure-1 : **Do different weight initialization matter?** The study is designed from the perspective of an AI user who can choose between multiple pretrained models (domain or non-domain, supervised or self-supervised) options for a given task. The best pretrained model is the one that has the highest accuracy on the task and is least affected by distribution shifts. This study provides a framework to choose amongst pretrained models and select the most advantageous for the task.
